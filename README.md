# WhatIsThatImage

Requirements
- As a creator of a post I want tags for my posts so that I can get quick responses.
  -	Given I tag my post with painting, when another user looks for posts with that tag, then search results show my post.
  -	Given my post has no tags, users who browse for posts with tags, then only those using post id or user will find the post.
- As a commentor, I want tag reputation so that I can reach those who need my expertise best.
  -	given I have high reputation in the pets tag, when a user look in the comments of a post with that tag, my comment will be near the top
  -	given I have no reputation in the location tag, when a user looks in the comments of a post with that tag, my post will be lower in the results.
